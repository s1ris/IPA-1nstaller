IPA-1nstaller
=============

My first open source project. The code is ugly (I know), and includes out of place code, poorly defined objects etc. As I update this project I'll include the source. I plan on learning better code arrangment, spacing and all that. Learning as I go...

This is a GUI frontend for Merlins' IPA Installer Console. Everything shown here is compiler ready for Theos (3.0 SDK), as its the only thing I have.
